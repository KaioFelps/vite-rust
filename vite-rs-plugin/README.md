# Vite Rust Plugin
Vite is a blazing fast frontend build tool powering the next generation of web applications.

`vite-rs-plugin` is a very small plugin heavily inspired by Laravel's [oficial plugin](https://github.com/laravel/vite-plugin/tree/1.x).
However, this is way more simple and provide less than a half of Laravel's.

It might be enough for non-complex Rust applications using `vite-rust` and `inertia_rs` crates.
For any more advanced usage, I recommend giving Laravel's plugin a try.

## Installing
```shell
$ npm i -D vite-rs-plugin
```

Head to [vite-rust example](../example/vite.config.ts) to see a `vite.config.ts`
sample using vite-rs-plugin.
